## Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM)

**Source Description:** The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) was created in 2009 to reach consensus on data types, study designs, and privacy concerns while sharing data.
An important output of OMOP is the OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) which is an effort to standardize observational data to enable transferable analysis. [@overhage2012validation]
The OMOP CDM features personÂ­centric design where each domain records personal identity while prioritizing data protection through the limiting of information that could endanger patient anonymity.
The CDM itself does not require a specific technology to work with the data stored in this standard.

Available OMOP CDM data sources:

 - **Eunomia** - Synthetic OMOP CDM data generated by Synthea available in a single sqlite file.
